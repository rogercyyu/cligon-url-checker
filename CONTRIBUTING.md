# CONTRIBUTING

Contributing to Cligon is easy.
Cligon is written in Python3 and requires a copy of it on your machine.
Please use Python 3.8.2 or higher.

## Prerequisite

If pip is not installed, install pip by running:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

pip is the standard package-management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.

## Use Virtualenv
Create a virtual env by using:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Format & Linting
Additionally, please use Visual Studio Code to ensure proper settings.
This project uses Python Black for formatting and Flake8 for linting and is automatically configured to run on save.

To format all files at once, use:
```bash
black .
```

To lint files use: 
```bash
flake8 .
```

Ensure you are inside your virtual env (.venv) when using the above commands.

## Git Pre-commit Hooks
It is recommended to use git pre-commit hooks for this project.
Please install pre-commit: 
```bash

```
And execute: 
```bash
pre-commit install
``` 
to install git hooks in to the `.git/` directory.


## Testing
To test project please run:
```bash
pytest
```
To run test code coverage:
```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```
To see test code coverage report:
```bash

Any tests are welcome. Even tests that are similar to existing tests.

Currently there is no organization to the tests except they are designed to test [UrlChecker](src/url_checker.py) and [UrlStatus](src/url_status.py).

An area they may need some tests is [cligon.py](src/cligon.py).

Also, please note, when writing assert test for the output, ensure to remember to put color codes to match the output of the teriminal.
